    <div id="application">


    <h1 class=" text-start text-2xl text-gray-50 my-8">Application</h1>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg">I have no farming or farm related experience; will l be able to get a job?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">The US farmers that use us as their preferred South African agent, have specific requirements and high standards for their candidates. Whilst a degree or diploma in agriculture is not mandatory, sufficient farming experience is.  Candidates that are the prime choice have got enough or adequate experience operating equipment: mostly John Deere & Case tractors, combines & self-propelled sprayers equipped with GPS self-steer systems as well as truck driving. Having grown up on a farm or being involved in the day to day running of it, is a prerequisite for these farmers. 
        These farmers expect to pick you up at the airport, take you to their farming operation and for you to be able to start working with minimal training and supervision as soon as possible. As most farmers are involved in every aspect of their business, plus doing a lot of work themselves, they are not able to train you, even if you are a fast learner and hardworking individual. 
        Regardless of skill level, all employees receive the same hourly rate. Thus, the farmer will choose the “best value for money” candidate(s).</p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">What type of photo should I upload to the application?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Please upload an ID / passport type photo. This means, you will have your head centered against a white background, only showing from the shoulders upwards. 
        Please DO NOT upload photos of your latest hunting adventure, paintball games, partying, at a braai or a photo with a group of friends. Applications with inappropriate photos will NOT be sent out to clients for review. This is the first impression you’re making on us & the farmer, choose wisely!</p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Can I complete my application in Afrikaans?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">No, these forms are being sent to US farmers, from which they will choose their employees. We will not be editing/rectifying forms to ensure that they are understandable for the farmer.</p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">When is the best time to submit my application?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">As soon as possible after receiving the online link from us. If you have not been placed through the year, please update your application at the end of the year (using the link provided to you when you submitted your form) so we can send it out as soon as the first requests start rolling in.</p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I am unable to complete my application in one sitting; will I lose what I’ve done thus far?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">No, if you need to complete your application at a later stage, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the “Save” button. This will enable you to copy a link to your application or have it emailed to you for later use. When you access your link, it will take you right back to where you left off. Your incomplete form will however expire in 7 days, so ensure to complete the application before the 7 days are over.</p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Some of the other agencies require me to upload a video, supporting documents (driver’s licence, testimonials or reference letters etc). The application form doesn’t make provision for this, do I need to email it separately?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We’ve never had a request from any of the farmers we do recruitment for, for any these documents or multimedia resumes. All the information we require has the appropriate fields to be completed in our application form.</p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I’ve submitted my online application; how will I know that you have received it?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">After submitting your online form, you will receive an email confirming your submission and an application reference number. We will also receive a notification email that an online form has been submitted to us. </p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Since submitting my online application, I’ve gained more experience; do I need to submit a new application?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">No, after you’ve completed the form & submitted it, you will receive an email confirmation. This email will also include a link for you to go back to your original application and add or amend any details. Please ensure that you save this email and/or the link provided to regain access to your existing application in the future!
        Please have a look at this infographic, to get an idea of the layout of the confirmation email with the link to return to your existing application</p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I submitted my application, but I haven't heard anything back?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We send out the applications to all the farmers that request workers. We will only notify you if you have been chosen. All communication is done via email, so please ensure the email address on the application is your active email address. We will use only this email address, not any other address.</p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I submitted my application, but I didn’t receive a confirmation email.</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Please check your spam / junk folders for the email - it should be from info@farmrecruitusa.com
        If it’s not in any of these folders, the most likely cause is that you have incorrectly entered your email address on the form. Please send us an email and we will assist in retrieving your application link for you to do the necessary amendments.</p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">What will cause my application to not be sent out?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Having completed the form in the incorrect format (eg. in Afrikaans; using an inappropriate photo or a photo of machinery; embellishing and/or enhancing experience etc.). </p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">What is the age limit for applying?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We have no maximum age limit, as long as you are physically fit & able to perform the required duties. We’ve placed a few guys over the ages of 40 & 50 with farmers in the southern states. Applicants under 21 years will have to complete information about their legal guardian. </p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">When do the farmers request workers? </h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Most of the inquiries for placements we receive happens mainly between November to February, even up to April of each year. However, we do have some farmers who require more workers later in the year over the busy harvest season. We will then have a few late placements and opportunities </p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I don’t have a passport yet; can I still apply?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Yes, you can. As soon as you get your passport, please update your from using the link provided to you after you submitted your form. </p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I’m a South African currently residing in another country, can I apply?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Unfortunately, at this stage we only recruit South African citizens residing in South Africa. </p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I am currently in the USA, but I am unhappy with my employer. Can you please move me to another farmer? </h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">The process involved to move an employee in the US from one farmer to another is very expensive & time consuming. Most of the farmers we work with, find it cheaper & more convenient to rather employ someone straight from South Africa. 
        Our advice to you: stick it out with the farmer you’re at. This reflects positively on you the next time you apply for a position. The prospective employer can see that you stayed the full contract term, rather than moving around through the year. </p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Is there anything I can do to make the process run as smoothly as possible? </h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Yes, if you or a family member don't have a credit card, please apply for one at your bank. (Even if you just open one with the minimum amount that your bank allows). This will make the visa payment process quicker, which means you can book an appointment immediately after completing the payment. </p>
    <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I never received OR I lost my Social Security Number / card. Where can I find it?</h2>
    <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Unfortunately we can’t assist with this. We are aware of a few websites where you can recover the information associated with your SSN, but this requires the SSN to log in.
        The following documents from the Social Security Administration contains the relevant information for lost/stolen SSN for foreigners:</p>
        <a href="" class="text-base text-blue-500  hover:underline">Non-U.S. Citizen/Adult - Replacement Social Security Card</a><br>
        <a href="" class="text-base text-blue-500 hover:underline">Foreign Workers and Social Security Numbers</a>
        <p class=" text-start text-sm text-gray-400">The above links are provided directly from the Social Security Administration’s website and was correct at the time of publishing on the Farm Recruit USA website. Please ensure that you check the SSA’s website to ensure you are using the most recent publications.

    <!-- ----------------------- PROCESS --------------------------------- -->
    <div class="process">
        <h1 class=" text-start text-2xl text-gray-50 my-8">PROCESS</h1>
        <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">What is the process after I submit my application? </h2>
        <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Once you've submitted your online application the following will happen: </p>
        <ol class=" list-decimal">
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400"> We receive an email notification that a new application has been submitted to us. We review each applicant and provide feedback if and as necessary. </li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">When we receive a request for applicants from the client and / or US agent, we will make a selection of candidates that fit the requirements we have received. For every position a farmer would like to fill, we send them 4 to 6 applications to review. </li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Once the farmer has made their selection, they will notify us & we will send out a formal offer of employment.</li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We require the offer of employment to be signed by you & returned to us. As soon as this is done, we notify the farmer of your acceptance of their offer.</li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We create a WhatsApp group with all the employees going to the same client. This makes for efficient communication between all parties. Please make sure that the number listed on the application form is the one that is used for WhatsApp. You will be added to the group after we have received the signed letter of acceptance.</li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">If you are returning to the same farmer, we will only add you to the group once your application form has been updated. This ensures we have all the correct details on record for the upcoming season, as we've noticed that a few details tend to change during the year</li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Once we receive the necessary documentation from the US side, we will disseminate the information & documents to all. <br> Please complete the necessary US Visa forms online & schedule your appointment at the consulate closest to you. <br>
                *As of 2018, some applicants who've worked in the US before, are only required to send their documents to the consulate. </li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">As soon as your appointment is confirmed, please let us know when it is, so we can keep everyone updated. </li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Make use of the consulate checklist that will be provided to you by us, to ensure that you have ALL the required documents. Your visa can be denied if you are missing only one document! 
            </li>
             <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Go to the consulate for the appointment & let us know if your visa has been approved or denied.</li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Next, we will start looking at flights that best suits the employer. The employer ultimately gives the go ahead on dates & costs. </li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">If we have more than one guy going to the same employer, we prefer to have everyone fly on the same flights, to make the trips to the airport for the employer as easy as possible.</li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">The flights will only be booked & confirmed once everyone going to the same employer has their passport back in hand from the consulate. </li>
            <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We provide a packing list as a guideline for you to use.</li>

        </ol>
        <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Will I have an interview with the farmer before receiving a formal offer of employment?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Not necessarily, this depends on the farmer. As we have built our application form over several seasons with the honest input from our farmers, many of them feel comfortable extending an offer of employment to a candidate based solely on the application form.
            Some farmers prefer to have an interview with the candidates before making a final decision.</p>
        <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">If the farmer wants to do an interview with me, how will this be done?</h2>
        <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We advise all our farmers to make use of WhatsApp, as this app allows for voice & video calls. We also know that this is the most used app by South Africans and is the easiest & most economical way of getting in contact.</p>
        <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">How long does the process take for me to receive an offer of employment? </h2>
        <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">There is no set time frame. We have quite frequent requests for guys at the beginning of the year, with fewer requests later in the year. You might get placed with a farmer within a few days, at other times it might take a few weeks to get placed. </p>
        <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I received and accepted a job offer, how long will it be until I am in the US?</h2>
        <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We can only start the process of applying for your visa, once we have received the documentation from the US state departments. We will only receive this <span class=" font-medium"> within 30 days prior to your contract start date.</span> <br>
            For example: if your start date is March 15th, we can only expect to receive the documents any time after February 15th. <br>
            As soon as we receive the documentation, we will send you the necessary information & documentation for you to complete your visa application & to schedule your consular interview.  
            Waiting times for an interview vary between the consulates/embassies and with the number of requests they have at any given time for a specific visa class. Each visa class’ interviews are only done on specific days of the week. <br>
            After attending your interview, it takes another 5 – 10 days for the consulate to return your passport to you. Only once everyone going to the same farm has their passports back, will we start looking at flights. <br> 
            Generally, you can work on 4 - 6 weeks from when the date the documentation is received till your arrival in the USA.</p>
        <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">How can I increase my chances of getting placed? </h2>
        <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Candidates with sufficient farming experience, thoroughly completed application & valid references will have a better chance of getting placed quickly than candidates with limited experience.</p>

    <div id="cost">

        <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">What fees do I need to pay to Farm Recruit USA?</h2>
        <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">There are no fees to be paid by you to Farm Recruit USA. The only costs you need to cover are that of the VISA & flights. </p>
        <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">What are the costs involved? </h2>
        <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Visa: ∓R3400 - 00  <br>
            The visa MRV Fee is US$190, the ZAR amount changes with the Rand / Dollar exchange rate.
            As of 2019, farmers are required by law to reimburse you the visa fee as well. <br> <br>Flights: Between R12 000 and R28 000 - Costs depend on the departure airport, final destination, day of flight, when the booking was made etc. 
            The cost of the flight is paid back to you by the employer. Depending on your contract, first half of the flight ticket is paid back within 48 hours of arrival & the other half at a later stage during your contract period.</p>

        <div id="travel">
     <h1 class=" text-start text-2xl text-gray-50 my-8">TRAVELING TO THE USA</h1>

       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Do I need to pack linens/bedding?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">No, the basics (linens, pots, pans, cutlery etc.) is provided to you by the farmer. You can take your own pillow if you’d like, also pack your own towels. We will email you a packing list to guide you in what to pack & what to leave behind. </p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Will I need to pay housing? What other costs will I need to cover whilst in the USA?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Housing is provided to the men by the farmer(s). This is usually a communal house (or houses, depending on the crew size) shared by the men of the same and/or neighbouring farmer(s). The housing is inspected by the US State Department and needs to comply with certain requirements before the farmer can even obtain H2A certification.
        You will be responsible for covering all your personal expenses - food, spices, toiletries, laundry detergents, own clothing, own entertainment etc.
        Most farmers will provide a vehicle for the men’s use, to enable them to visit the nearby towns & stores.
        </p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Which airline will I be flying with?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We prefer to book with Delta, they fly to most of the destinations that the farmers request. Booking directly with the airline also keeps the costs down and booking with one airline, makes changing connecting flights easier when you've missed yours (eg. due to customs & immigration processes being slow). We will however sometimes make use of other airlines, solely because Delta doesn't serve the airport to which you are required to fly to. </p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">My flight has been delayed or changed, who do I notify?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">All of the airports have free WiFi available, please connect to this and notify us on the WhatsApp group as soon as you know how long you’ll be delayed and / or of any flight changes. We will then notify the farmer and the US agent of these changes.</p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I want to book through a travel agent, will that be okay?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We have teamed up with a very competent lady with one of SA’s biggest travel agencies. We make use of her service, as she is willing to assist us any day of the week & understands the process & requirements involved. Her excellent service ensures that we can get everyone a fair deal & to make the process of group bookings run smoothly. With her help, she is able to secure a booking & cost for 24 hours, enabling payments to be made by either EFT, credit card or in-store payments. <br> Please speak to us if you wish to use another travel agent.</p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I want to change my flights, can you assist?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">When you decide to make a change to your flights (eg. earlier return date), unfortunately Farm Recruit USA can't assist with that. If you've booked through an airline directly, you will have to contact them to do the flight change. Check on their website for the local contact numbers & remember to have your confirmation number ready when phoning.
        If you've booked through a travel agent, you will have to contact them to do the flight change. We've noticed from past experience that the travel agent will want to speak to the traveler directly, not via email. This creates a problem as the traveler (you) will be in the US, whilst your travel agent is in SA. The time difference itself creates a problem & international calls will cost quite a bit. When booking through a travel agent, discuss this possibility with them beforehand. Designate a friend or family member who can contact them on your behalf should you decide to change your flight whilst in the USA.</p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Who covers the fees (if there are any) when I change my flights?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Most of the time there will be a cost to changing your flight. It can be a combination of a change fee & the difference between fares, or just one or the other. You will have to pay this cost to have your flight changed. The farmer will not be covering this fee, this is for your own expense.</p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">What are my baggage allowances?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Check with your airline what is the allowed maximum bags & weights. It's usually 2 bags at 23kg (50lbs) each for checked in bags, but make sure before you go!</p> 
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400 mt-4">Comply with the TSA regulations:</p>
       <ol class=" list-disc">
        <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">You are allowed to bring a quart-sized bag of liquids, aerosols, gels, creams and pastes in your carry-on bag and through the checkpoint. These are limited to travel-sized containers that are 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item, that fit in 1 quart sized resealable bag.
        </li>
        <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Locked baggage: In order to ensure the safe transportation of travelers, TSA (Transportation Security Agency) screens all checked and carry-on baggage before it is permitted to be brought onboard commercial aircraft. Technology generally enables us to electronically screen bags without opening them, but there are times when we need to physically inspect a piece of luggage. TSA has worked with several companies to develop locks that can be opened by security officers using universal "master" keys so that the locks may not have to be cut. In some cases, TSA officers will have to open your baggage as part of the screening process. If your bag is unlocked, then our officer will simply open and screen the baggage if any item alarms. However, if you decide to lock your checked baggage and TSA cannot open it through other means, then the locks may have to be cut. For soft-sided baggage, this process will not damage your zippers or zipper pulls. TSA is careful to not damage any personal belongings, however, we are not liable for damage caused to locked bags that must be opened for security purposes. Please note that if an officer does need to open your bag, a “Notice of Baggage Inspection” will be place in your bag.</li>

       </ol>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">My bank gives me travel insurance when I use my credit card to book flights, can you give me more details on the benefits?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">With the vast amount of benefits offered by the various banks, we unfortunately don’t have all the details. Visit or call your nearest branch and get the details from them. They will also provide you with the most recent & accurate information.</p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Can you give me travel and/or medical insurance/cover?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">We do not provide travel and/or medical insurance/cover, but we can recommend a few organizations who do. Please let us know if you will require a nudge in the right direction.
        Please contact your medical aid to confirm with them if they will cover you and for what period.
        If you are injured whilst on duty, the farmer’s workers compensation will cover those medical expenses.</p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">My work contract says I’ll be working in one state, but my final destination is in another state; why is this?
    </h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">The employer decides on the closest airport to him, which makes the pick-up & drop off easier & reduces traveling times between the airport and the farm. It often happens that an airport in another state is just a few minutes away as opposed to an airport in the same state which might be a few hours away.</p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">My brother/uncle/father/cousin and I are both going to the US, but to different farmers. We’ve been advised to book on different airlines; why is this?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">When you and a friend/ family member are going to the US, but to different farmers, & we advise you to use different airlines, we have a reason for that. You might be able to go to your final destination on Delta, whilst your friend/ family member will be flying to the final destination on American Airlines. Some airlines don't operate to the preferred airports, whilst others do. You might think that, let's say, Delta flies to an airport within the state you'll be going to, that that might be the best option. However, that airport might be another 4 hour's drive by bus away from where your farmer wants you. But when you book on American Airlines, the airport will be 30minutes away. It's easy to see which is the better option.</p>

    <div id="expectations">
     <h1 class=" text-start text-2xl text-gray-50 my-8">WORK EXPECTATIONS IN THE USA</h1>

       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">What can be expected from me when I am working in the USA?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">The work performed by employees in the US varies greatly depending on the farmers needs and the employees experience. Manual labour will have to be performed and may include: digging holes, cleaning out ditches with shovels, cleaning out silos (grain bins),cleaning out rotten seed from seed carts, combines, semi-trucks or grain carts, laying of poly pipe, spraying chemicals with backpack sprayers, repair and change worn tires, cleaning & washing of machinery & workshops etc. Some of this work like laying poly pipe may be done in temperatures exceeding 40०C and high humidity. Be prepared and willing to do any job required from you by the employer.</p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Will I be exclusively operating equipment (tractors, trucks, combines etc.)?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400"> No, definitely not. The visa class is for a “seasonal farm labourer” and the duties include, but is not limited to:</p>
       <ul class="list-disc">
        <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">assisting with planting, tillage, irrigation, chemical or fertilizer application </li>
        <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">harvesting and delivery to packaging and/or processing facilities </li>
        <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">loading seed into planters properly and operate equipment to plant crops </li>
        <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400"> participating in irrigation activities including laying pipe, setting up and operating irrigation equipment and clearing and maintaining irrigation ditches  </li>
        <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400"> building, constructing and maintaining levees, installing and removing levy gates and putting in spillways</li>
        <li class="text-start text-base text-gray-400"> using hand tools and equipment to repair, clean and maintain farm vehicles, machinery and specialized machinery and agricultural equipment</li>
       </ul>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">I’m not happy with the hourly rate that I will be getting, can we negotiate for a higher rate? </h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">Unfortunately, the hourly rate is set out per state and each employed individual can’t be paid different rates. The employer must pay all covered workers the Federal or State statutory minimum wage in effect at the time work is performed. </p>
       <h2 class="text-start text-gray-300 font-medium  text-lg mt-7">Am I guaranteed a minimum weekly number of hours worked?</h2>
       <p class="text-start text-base text-gray-400">No, there is no minimum hours guaranteed per week. The work is weather dependent, some weeks might be a low hour week, due to rains, whilst other weeks might keep you busy most of the day. The minimum hours described in the contract is only applicable at the end of the season, if the minimum hours for the season has not been achieved. 
        You are guaranteed 75% of the minimum hours per season. <br>This means the following: <br>If the contract states 40 hours minimum per week and you will be employed for 30 weeks, you will be guaranteed to get paid no less than 75% of those hours at the end of the season.
        The math: 40hrs x 30weeks = 1200 total hours; 3/4ths guarantee: 75% of 1200hrs = 900 hours 
        If you have worked more than the minimum guaranteed hours during the season, this is not valid.</p>
